**Project Summary**
- We construct novel news-based indicators of Brexit uncertainty at both aggregate and topic-specific level for the UK economy  (such as Northern Ireland, supply chain issues, and energy & climate), based on textual analysis and unsupervised machine learning methods.

- These Brexit uncertainty indices (BUI) capture well UK firms’ concerns reported by the Bank of England’s Decision Maker Panel surveys.

- These monthly indices are cost-effective and can be updated in close to real time, which are advantageous to policy evaluation compared to traditional large firm surveys.

- They also allow for disentangling the Brexit effects from those of the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that the pandemic accounted for around half of the overall uncertainty index post 2020, and this magnification effect varies significantly across policy areas.

## Aggregate Brexit Uncertainty Index

### Aggregate BUI (2013- December 2022)
![general](./assets/images/general2.png)

-BUI: A monthly index based on the frequency of news articles that concern Brexit uncertainty. The index is normalized to a maximum value of 100. 

- Lower Bound BUI: A monthly index based on the frequency of news articles that concern Brexit uncertainty, excluding all articles mentioning COVID related words after January 2020. 

#### Comparison to Twitter BUI

- Twitter BUI: An index that we construct based on the same methodology for the news-based BUI, but using instead the frequency of Twitter tweets concerning Brexit uncertainty.
#### Comparison to Stock Market Volatility
